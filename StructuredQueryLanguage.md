VALUES ('John', 'Doe');
```

```

## 6. GROUP BY Clause

Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows.

```sql
SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1;
```

**Example**:  
```sql
SELECT department_id, COUNT(employee_id)
FROM employees

## 7. HAVING Clause

**Example**:  
```sql
SELECT department_id, COUNT(employee_id)
